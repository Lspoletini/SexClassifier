## Description:

- Compared preprocessing pipelines for handling data from the [Young-Adult Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult)
- Extracted features from fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) data pertaining to temporal complexity, including sample entropy and fALFF (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations).
- 
- Used these novel features to perform out-of-sample prediction of patient sex on unlabeled data, achieving prediction accuracy (84%) on par with contemporary literature on the subject.
- *Packages: keras, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.*
- *Skills: support vector machines, logistic regression, neural networks, academic writing*


Note: Apologies to anyone looking for the scripts from this project,  it is on an old machine that I do not have access to at the moment.
